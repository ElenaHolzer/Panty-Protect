- 2D Arcade
- made with Unity
- my second GameDev Project (still in the making)

After finishing [Crocky in the Sewer](https://github.com/ElenaHolzer/Crocky-in-the-Sewer) I tried to apply what has been learned by making a similar 2D game with Unity but with slightly different parameters such as falling items, UI elements and different controls.
